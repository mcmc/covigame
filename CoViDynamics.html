    <h2>Try to minimize deaths and minimize economic damage.</h2>

    <p> You are the leader of your community.
    <br> You can decide how much social isolation to enforce, whether to cancel events,
    <br> whether people should wear masks, whether they should shake hands, and so on.
    <br> All of this turns into a single number, the <b>transmission factor</b>, which you control.
    </p>
    <p> You can decide whether to focus more on deaths or more on the economy.
    <br> Either way, as you practice, you will see why you need to get the transmission
    <br> factor down.  Whether you do this through social distancing, contact tracing,
    <br> or other measures is up to you, and is not modeled by the game.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What is the purpose of this game?  Do you not take it seriously?</h2>

    <p> We take it very seriously.
    <br> We have been shocked at the degree to which people (including ourselves)
    <br> did not understand much at all about the way social distancing measures do or don't help,
    <br> what herd immunity is and isn't, and what sort of future we can expect under various policy approaches.
    </p>
    <p> The purpose of the game is to help ourselves and other people understand how these factors interact.
    </p>
    <p> For example, if you get good at the game, you will see that your strategy does not depend much
    <br> at all on the exact parameters. So even though we don't have good data yet on the parameters
    <br> of this virus, we can still implement a close-to-optimal policy by carefully monitoring the
    <br> state of our medical system and adjusting the social distancing measures accordingly.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The Transmission Factor</h2>

    <p> The <b>transmission factor</b> is the average number of other people that an infected citizen
    <br> will transmit the virus to, before the infected citizen either (1) develops an immune response
    <br> and defeats the infection without showing symptoms, (2) develops symptoms and self-isolates
    <br> (for mild to "like-a-bad-flu" cases), or (3) develops symptoms and gets hospitalized (severe cases).
    </p>
    <p> The transmission factor is the average for all people, including all those 3 types of cases.
    </p>
    <p> If the virus is transmitted to somebody who already had the virus, the
    <br> target is considered to be immune, and does not become contagious again.
    </p>
    <p> So if some fraction of the population is immune, then the virus will only be able to infect a fraction of
    <br> the people it is transmitted to.  This is effectively like having a lower transmission factor.  In the game, this
    <br> corresponds to how the green line maps to lower transmission factors (grey lines) as you move to the right.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What does the curved green line represent?</h2>

    <p> The curved green line is to help with the intuition that an epidemic is kind of like a ball rolling down a hill.
    <br> The steeper the hill, the faster the ball will speed up.
    <br> The ball is kind of like a bean-bag: If the hill is not steep enough, the ball will slow down and stop.
    </p>
    <p> The green curve is steeper on the left, because the virus spreads more easily when nobody has caught the virus yet.
    <br> Above the yellow line, the curve is steep enough to make the ball roll faster.
    <br> Below the yellow line, the curve is not steep enough and the ball will slow down.
    </p>
    <p> The height of the left-hand end of the curve, where the magenta dot is,
    <br> represents the transmission factor.
    <br> Really, it is not the height that matters, but the angle to the endpoint, as indicated by the grey lines.
    <br> The gray line you are currently at determines the rate at which the epidemic will grow or shrink.
    <br> Your position is shown by the little green dot under the rolling virus ball.
    </p>
    <p> The "physics" of the ball follows "epidemic physics", which is slightly different from
    <br> "gravity physics", but still the intuition is close enough for it to be a useful analogy.
    <br> The difference is just that the speed of the ball is given by the vertical extent of the
    <br> "trail" of red people behind the ball, rather than by any physical "momentum", so the
    <br> speed of the ball can be changed at any time, just by changing the transmission factor.
    </p>
    
    <h2>What do the colors of people mean?</h2>

    <p> Purple people have not yet contracted the virus.
    <br> Red people contracted the virus recently and are contagious.
    <br> Blue people have recovered from the virus and are no longer contagious.
    <br> Note that red people may or may not show symptoms.  Only a fraction of the red people need to be
    <br> hospitalized, and an even smaller fraction of them die.  These numbers are shown only in the charts.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Epidemic vs. Pandemic</h2>
    
    <p>The coronavirus pandemic is a pandemic because it is spread over the world.
    <br>It consists of many many local epidemics.  This game models such an epidemic.
    </p>
    <p> When there are different sub-populations that have little interaction with each other
    <br> (and perhaps different social distancing behavior), then a more complex model is needed.
    <br> This is typically due to geographical/cultural separation, but can also correspond to different
    <br> subpopulations in a single society, if these subpopulations have limited contact with each other.
    </p>
    </p> This game models a single population in which the individual
    <br> variation in behavior is effectively random across the population.
    </p>
    
    <h2>"Herd immunity" and the dotted yellow line</h2>

    <p> A dotted yellow line is visible above.
    <br> The farther the virus ball is above this region, the faster the epidemic will grow.
    <br> The farther the virus ball is below this region, the faster the epidemic will shrink.
    <br> If you are close to the line, the epidemic will stay about the same size.
    <br> (Staying the same size means it spreads to new people at the same rate that people recover at.)
    </p>
    <p> When the transmission factor is normal (yes, many things can influence what you consider to be
    <br> "normal"), then herd immunity occurs at the point where the green line crosses the yellow line.
    </p>
    <p> If a population has "herd immunity", it doesn't mean the people are all immune.  People can still catch the disease.
    <br> It just means that any outbreaks that do occur will have a limited spread, and the outbreak will end itself naturally.
    <br> The higher the level of herd immunity, the quicker the flare-ups will die back down.
    </p>
    <p> Herd immunity is not a strategy.  It is a phenomenon.
    <br> (Just like the pandemic itself is not a strategy.  It is a phenomenon.)
    <br> The point at which this phenomenon occurs depends on the transmission factor,
    <br> which depends both on properties of the virus <i>and on societal behavior</i>.
    <br> For example it will occur at a different point in a culture where people are very social and physically
    <br> close, than in a culture where people meet rarely and remain physically distant even when they meet.
    </p>
    <p> Herd immunity (perhaps thanks to a vaccine) is the only way that an epidemic can end, unless
    <br> transmission-reduction measures are kept in place, such as social distancing or contact tracing.
    <br> Even then, you could argue that these measures simply make herd-immunity happen sooner.
    </p>
    <p> (The epidemic can also end by eradicating the virus, but that is practically impossible
    <br> once an outbreak stops being contained, as is the case here.  Even when there is a
    <br> vaccine, it is still very difficult. We have been trying to eradicate the poliovirus
    <br> for decades, but immunity is still achieved via herd immunity, via vaccines.)
    </p>
    <p> In this game, herd immunity is the phenomenon that the virus ball slows down and
    <br> stops <i>before</i> hitting 100%, even when the magenta dot on the left is above the line.
